    <richText>What makes a good exploitation movie? BFI's Tim Lucas believes it's "a movie that makes you want to run, not walk, to the nearest shower, but leaves you unable to decide whether the shower should be hot or cold." Coming up at Drama House is a free screening of two movies that will do just that in an exploitation double feature, complete with vintage trailers and theater ads from the 70s.&#xD;&#xD;We are still working on securing the rights to the first feature, so that will be announced soon, but the second feature of the evening will definitely be "The Abductors" starring Cheri Caffaro as Ginger McAllister, a 23-year-old ex-cheerleader who goes undercover to stop a ring of sex-related crimes.&#xD;&#xD;The films and trailers will be projected on the big screen in the main room at Drama House and popcorn will be served.&#xD;&#xD;For more information on "The Abductors" and other exploitation classics of grindhouse cinema, visit&#xD;&lt;a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49375"&gt;http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49375&lt;/a&gt;</richText>
